                    <h3>Optquency</h3>
                    NuVerde LLC. is an independent consultant for a new quantum entanglement process that delivers a discrete exchange in light and vibrations through waves. The system produces an optimal environment for your plants and the company's guarantees a 5 to 20% additional plant growth. This system can also be programmed to alleviate any insect infestation problems and it is 100% herbicide and pesticide free. We can conduct test on your land, warehouses, etc... for proof of concept
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <h3>Organic Fertilizer</h3>
                    NuVerde LLC provides laboratory and engineering services engaged in the furtherance of green farming or i.e. soil bioremediation using totally organic components. The laboratory fertilizer increases soil tilth to lower irrigation water requirements. No single program works on all sites; therefore, we customize the fertilizer to meet the farmer’s needs, after reviewing our customer’s soil analysis and can provide this product with a NuVerde LLC label or any companies private label.

                    <h3>Natural Oil Cleaner (NOC) Land and Sea (NOC L and S)</h3>
                    a proprietary blend of certified organic natural compounds (microbial organisms) that totally degrade hydrocarbons in the presence of a unique humate product for Heavy, Medium & Light crude oil; Gasoline and Diesel spills. NOC-L residue enhances vegetative root systems & acts as fertilizer in the affected area (totally environmentally friendly). NOC-S leaves only natural components in the water, which function as fish food with no harmful chemicals or by-products. We provide NOC samples to potential customers for testing purposes
                  </p>

                    <h3>NV1</h3>
                    NV1 is a heavy-duty, non-caustic, detergent degreaser that contains multiple surfactants and mutual solvent and is designed to cost effectively remove a variety of hydrocarbon fouling’s. It is used to clean and degrease the external surfaces of pumps, compressors, towers, reactors, piping, aluminum insulation, structural steel supports, and concrete floors and pads. We can provide NV1 samples to potential customers for testing purposes.

                    <h3>Extraction Equipment</h3>
                    In addition, I work with a company that has a new generation of Extraction Equipment (Ethanol). They are looking for investors or wholesalers right now for their ethanol-based systems. They have several of the industry’s COOLEST nonvolatile forms of small batch extraction. Their evaporators are a -40° vacuum sealed “Explosion Proof” essential oil extraction

                    unit capable of reclamation by way of critically cold operations under negative pressure, but they have a new larger system and I'm waiting for the specifications. The systems are designed with the most robust borosilicate glass for better condensation and high acid and alkali resistant coatings. They are a premier consulting and extraction technology company capable of not only assisting in diversified regulatory statue but supporting unique extraction equipment and techniques to fit the most demanding of producers.

                    Many states are starting to submit legislation to restrict companies from using solvent extraction systems, because of the explosive potential; therefore, this system meets that need with ethanol. In fact.in Colorado, this is considered a water-based system. They are working with counties in California, because all systems in California are considered type 7 and they are working to get their system classified as type 6. A type 6 system can be operated outside a lab environment with less regulatory BS, hence, the NICHE of this company.

                    <h3>Carbon 60</h3>
                    I’m a distributor for this product. This is the most efficient known free radical scavenger and 172 times more potent and antioxidant than Vitamin C. 34 oxygen radicals have been added onto a single C60 molecule. C60 fullerene is able to cross the blood-brain barrier, can react with many superoxides without being consumed, derivatives are rapidly absorbed by tissues and excreted through urinary tract; low to no toxicity in vitro and in vivo in studies, possess large amount of conjugated double bonds and low lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital which can easily take up an electron from an attack of an oxygen radical, potentially therapeutic against arthritic pain, cancer, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and neurodegenerative disorders like Dementia, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s from performed research.
